# A-genetic-network-for-host-control-of-phyllosphere-microbiota-for-plant-health
The phyllosphere (above-ground parts) of plants are essential for photosynthesis, crop productivity and ecosystem health, and represents one of the most abundant habitats for microbiota colonization on earth. Yet, how plants control phyllosphere microbiota for health and productivity remains poorly understood at the mechanistic level. Here we found that the Arabidopsis quadruple mutant (min7 fls2 erf cerk1 [mfec]) defective in pattern-triggered immunity and the MIN7 vesicle traffic pathway or the constitutively activated cell death1 (cad1) mutant defective in a membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain protein displayed poor phyllosphere health. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was dramatically reduced, whereas Proteobacteria are enriched in the mfec and cad1 mutants, bearing a striking cross-kingdom resemblance to what occurs in human inflammatory bowel disease. Synthetic community reconstruction and community transplantation experiments revealed a causal role of a diverse and healthy level of leaf bacterial community in phyllosphere health. Our results uncovered an evolutionarily ancient molecular framework that allows terrestrial plants to control a diverse, balanced endophytic leaf microbiota to ensure phyllosphere health.
